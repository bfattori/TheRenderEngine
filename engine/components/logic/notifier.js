/**
 * @class A component which notifies objects when an action occurs.  The component
 *        uses a subscriber model to notify an object when certain actions occur.
 *        This component can be used so that multiple objects could subscribe to one
 *        to be notified when a particular event occurs.  The objects don't have to
 *        exist within the same scope.
 *        <p/>
 *        For example, a host object could publish an event of type "death" that other
 *        hosts are listening for.  Thus, when the host dies, it can pass relevant
 *        information that other objects (such as a life counter) could respond to.
 *        Rather than the host having to actively know about other parts of the
 *        game world, those other objects could "listen in" on the actions of the host
 *        and act accordingly.
 *
 * @param name {String} The name of the component
 * @param [priority=1.0] {Number} The priority of the component
