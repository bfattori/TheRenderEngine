/**
 * @class A component which responds to mouse events and notifies
 * the host object when one of the events occurs.  The <tt>R.engine.GameObject</tt> should
 * add event handlers for any of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li><tt>mouseover</tt> - The mouse moved over the host object, or the object moved under the mouse</li>
 * <li><tt>mouseout</tt> - The mouse moved out of the host object (after being over it)</li>
 * <li><tt>mousedown</tt> - A mouse button was depressed, while over the object</li>
 * <li><tt>mouseup</tt> - A mouse button was released</li>
 * <li><tt>click</tt> - A mouse button was depressed, and released, while over the object</li>
 * <li><tt>mousemove</tt> - The mouse was moved</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each event is passed the event object and a {@link R.struct.MouseInfo MouseInfo} structure which
 * contains information about the mouse event in the context of a game.
 * <p/>
 * <i>Note: The rendering context that the object is contained within needs to enable mouse event
 * capturing with the {@link R.rendercontexts.AbstractRenderContext#captureMouse} method.</i>
 * Objects which wish to be notified via the <tt>mouseover</tt> event handler will need to define
 * a bounding box.
 *
 * @param name {String} The unique name of the component.
 * @param priority {Number} The priority of the component among other input components.
 * @extends R.components.Input
 * @constructor
 * @description Create a mouse input component.
