/**
 * @class Loads tile resources and makes them available to the system.  Tiles are
 *        defined by an external JSON resource file.  A tile definition file
 *        is a JSON file which is nearly identical to sprite sheets.  The format
 *        describes the image which contains the sprites, the dimensions of the image,
 *        the version of the file, and the tile definitions.  Tiles can be either single
 *        frames or animations.  Animations are expected to be sequentially organized
 *        in the bitmap from left to right.  Each frame of an animation must be the exact
 *        same dimensions.
 *        <p/>
 *        A frame is simply defined by the upper left corner of the tile and the
 *        width and height of the frame.  For an animation, the first four entries are
 *        the same as a frame, followed by the frame count, the millisecond delay between
 *        frames, and the type of animation (either "loop" or "toggle").  A looped animation
 *        will play all frames, indicated by the frame count, and then start again from the
 *        beginning of the animation.  A toggled animation will play from the first to
 *        the last frame, then play from the last to the first, and then repeat.  The
 *        first and last frame will not be repeated in a toggled animation.  Thus, if
 *        the frames are A, B, C, then the toggle will play as A, B, C, B, A, B...
 *        <p/>
 *        The sparsity value is used to produce each tile's solidity map so that the map
 *        will consist of averaged pixels, resulting in a simplified map for collisions.
 *        The transparencyThreshold determines above what alpha value a pixel is no longer
 *        considered transparent, but solid.  Setting the assumeOpaque flag will short-circuit
 *        all solidity map calculations and assume all tiles to be completely opaque.
 *
